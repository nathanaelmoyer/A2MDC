Hi Information Technology,

Thank you for purchasing ieSpell! Please find attached, your personalized
registration key. To import into ieSpell, please follow the steps below:

1) Save the attached file (ieSpell.lic) into a temporary location on your
hard drive. (NOTE: It is advised that you save this file in a safe location
as it contains your registration information.)

2) Goto "ieSpell Options" and click on "Enter License..."

3) Using the file chooser dialog, select the key file (ieSpell.lic)

4) That's it!


If you need to automate the roll out of ieSpell, you may use the command
line syntax below (this command will install ieSpell silently and register
the product)

<install filename> /S /K=[Path to license key file]

E.g. if your install file and license file are both in C:\temp, then your
command will look like this:

C:\temp>ieSpellSetup.exe /S /K=C:\temp\ieSpell.lic

To know more about the command line options available, specify the /?
Switch.

If you are unable to see/save the attachment, please create a new text file
called "ieSpell.lic" and save the following information into the file.
